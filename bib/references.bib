	abstract = {Objective: In this systematic review, we aim to synthesize the literature on the use of natural language processing (NLP) and text mining as they apply to symptom extraction and processing in electronic patient-authored text (ePAT). Materials and methods: A comprehensive literature search of 1964 articles from PubMed and EMBASE was narrowed to 21 eligible articles. Data related to purpose, text source, number of users and/or posts, evaluation metrics, and quality indicators were recorded.
Results: Pain (n = 18) and fatigue and sleep disturbance (n = 18) were the most frequently evaluated symptom clinical content categories. Studies accessed ePAT from sources such as Twitter and online community forums or patient portals focused on diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and depression. Fifteen studies used NLP as a primary methodology. Studies reported evaluation metrics including the precision, recall, and F-measure for symptom-specific research questions. Discussion: NLP and text mining have been used to extract and analyze patient-authored symptom data in a wide variety of online communities. Though there are computational challenges with accessing ePAT, the depth of information provided directly from patients offers new horizons for precision medicine, characterization of subclinical symptoms, and the creation of personal health libraries as outlined by the National Library of Medicine.
Conclusion: Future research should consider the needs of patients expressed through ePAT and its relevance to symptom science. Understanding the role that ePAT plays in health communication and real-time assessment of symptoms, through the use of NLP and text mining, is critical to a patient-centered health system.},

Many people use these platforms to share their views, opinions and experiences. Analyzing such information is significant for any organization as it apprises the organization to understand the need of their customers. Sentiment analysis is an intelligible way to interpret the emotions from the textual information and it helps to determine whether that emotion is positive or negative. This paper outlines the data cleaning and data preparation process for sentiment analysis and presents experimental findings that demonstrates the comparative performance analysis of various classification algorithms. In this context, we have analyzed various machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machine, and Multinomial Naive Bayes) and deep learning techniques (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, and Long Short-Term Memory) for sentiment analysis.},

Lots of social networking sites are being used for expressing thoughts and opinions by users to rate products. These user opinionated text is highly unstructured in nature and thus involves the application of various natural language processing techniques. In aspect based sentiment analysis, the various features of a product is identiﬁed through the training process. For e.g. the aspects of a camera are picture quality, size, resolution etc. The quantitative analysis of each aspect is done using support vector machine classiﬁer. In most of the previous works, a product review is analysed as a whole rather than considering each aspect of it. Aspect based opinion mining is tedious since the identiﬁcation of individual features is in itself a challenging task.},

	abstract = {The social media is becoming an increasing trend for sharing the thoughts, ideas, opinions, etc. based on online reviews which generates a tremendous amount of unstructured data (ie. User posts). For processing those unstructured data supervised learning algorithms are preferred which helps for better performance optimization. Few years ago, Deep Learning (DL) techniques (ie. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)) models has become popular in healthcare applications by giving the rise in complicacy of the healthcare data. Deep Learning (DL) Techniques provides an effective and efficient model for data analysis by uncovering the masked patterns and find the meaningful information from the significant amount of health data whereas the traditional analytics does not able to produce within a stipulated period. Specifically, Deep Learning (DL) techniques consist of yielding good results by using the models of pattern recognition for social healthcare networks. The study of this paper focuses on by investigating the models of deep learning (DL) techniques applied to classify the text in social media healthcare networks. The main intention of this review provides an insight for training the data and to classify the text by analyzing and extracting the raw input and produce the output with the help of Natural language processing (NLP). Overall, the purpose of this review is to enhance the performance of the text classifier based on effectiveness to improve accuracy and text processing speed by using a suitable methodology in order produce the promising results in the future.},

	abstract = {The rise of social media has brought the rise of fake news and this fake news comes with negative consequences. With fake news being such a huge issue, efforts should be made to identify any forms of fake news however it is not so simple. Manually identifying fake news can be extremely subjective as determining the accuracy of the information in a story is complex and difficult to perform, even for experts. On the other hand, an automated solution would require a good understanding of NLP which is also complex and may have difficulties producing an accurate output. Therefore, the main problem focused on this project is the viability of developing a system that can effectively and accurately detect and identify fake news. Finding a solution would be a significant benefit to the media industry, particularly the social media industry as this is where a large proportion of fake news is published and spread. In order to find a solution to this problem, this project proposed the development of a fake news identification system using deep learning and natural language processing. The system was developed using a Word2vec model combined with a Long Short-Term Memory model in order to showcase the compatibility of the two models in a whole system. This system was trained and tested using two different dataset collections that each consisted of one real news dataset and one fake news dataset. Furthermore, three independent variables were chosen which were the number of training cycles, data diversity and vector size to analyze the relationship between these variables and the accuracy levels of the system. It was found that these three variables did have a significant effect on the accuracy of the system. From this, the system was then trained and tested with the optimal variables and was able to achieve the minimum expected accuracy level of 90\%. The achieving of this accuracy levels confirms the compatibility of the LSTM and Word2vec model and their capability to be synergized into a single system that is able to identify fake news with a high level of accuracy.},

The most efficient and popular method for learning from and training social media datasets is deep learning. In a range of applications, including audio, picture, and natural language processing, it has been demonstrated to be more successful. A text block is evaluated using the sentiment technique to determine whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. Not all members of the public express their feelings in the same way; as a result, some do so through comments and ratings while others do so through texts that don't reflect the right frame of mind. This evaluation lists the most typical and well-liked sentiment analysis algorithms for social media data. The classification of positive, negative, and neutral reviews using “LSTM, Knearest method, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, RNN, and MaLSTM” is explored and examined in this work. All of these classification methods were evaluated along with their drawbacks and difficulties.},
